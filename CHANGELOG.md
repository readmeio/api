### BREAKING CHANGE

* this is a breaking change.

* chore: relax commitlint rules on body and footer length

Taken from main codebase

* feat: remove res.json() line from the httpsnippet client

* fix: always output `.then(res => console.log(res))` in code sample

Since we dont know if the response is json or not, we can't make
assumptions. In an ideal world we'd conditionally do this based
on the accept header in the response, but Operation.getHeaders() only
returns with an array of headers and not their actual values. I think
this is good enough for now!

### BREAKING CHANGE

* this is a breaking change.

* chore: relax commitlint rules on body and footer length

Taken from main codebase

* feat: remove res.json() line from the httpsnippet client

* fix: always output `.then(res => console.log(res))` in code sample

Since we dont know if the response is json or not, we can't make
assumptions. In an ideal world we'd conditionally do this based
on the accept header in the response, but Operation.getHeaders() only
returns with an array of headers and not their actual values. I think
this is good enough for now!

### BREAKING CHANGE

* this is a breaking change.

* chore: relax commitlint rules on body and footer length

Taken from main codebase

* feat: remove res.json() line from the httpsnippet client

* fix: always output `.then(res => console.log(res))` in code sample

Since we dont know if the response is json or not, we can't make
assumptions. In an ideal world we'd conditionally do this based
on the accept header in the response, but Operation.getHeaders() only
returns with an array of headers and not their actual values. I think
this is good enough for now!

### BREAKING CHANGE

* this is a breaking change.

* chore: relax commitlint rules on body and footer length

Taken from main codebase

* feat: remove res.json() line from the httpsnippet client

* fix: always output `.then(res => console.log(res))` in code sample

Since we dont know if the response is json or not, we can't make
assumptions. In an ideal world we'd conditionally do this based
on the accept header in the response, but Operation.getHeaders() only
returns with an array of headers and not their actual values. I think
this is good enough for now!
