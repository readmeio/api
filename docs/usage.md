## Code generation

The code generation installation process that `api` offers comes in the form of an `api` CLI that will:

- Download and cache your OpenAPI definition into a `.api/` directory.
- Generate a full `api` library appropriate for the language you want.
  - Note that only TypeScript and JavaScript (targeting CommonJS or ECMAScript) are available right now but more languages are planned for the future. ✨
- Install necessary packages required for the generated library to run.
- Install an `@api/your-api` package in your local `package.json`
  - This allows you to use the library with `require('@api/your-api')` or `import '@api/your-api'`.

Once you have your library generated and installed you can use your SDK like you would any other:

```js
const petstore = require('@api/petstore');

petstore.listPets().then(({ data, status, headers, res }) => {
  console.log(`My pets name is ${data[0].name}!`);
});
```

And if you use an IDE with TypeScript support (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), you get the benefit of having autogenerated TypeScript types to help you out—regardless if you're actually using TypeScript!
