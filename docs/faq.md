### Does this support YAML definitions?

Yes! YAML definitions will be automatically converted to JSON when they're fetched for either SDK code generation or dynamic `api` usage.

### Does this support Swagger 2.0 definitions?

At the moment it does not. If you wish to use an API that has a Swagger 2.0 file, you'll need to first convert it to an OpenAPI 3 definition.

### Does this support traditional OAuth 2 flows of creating tokens?

Not yet, unfortunately. For APIs that use OAuth 2, you'll need a fully-qualified token already for `api` to make requests.

### Does this support APIs that use multiple forms of authentication on a single request?

Not yet! This is something we're thinking about how to handle, but it's difficult with the simplified nature of the `.auth()` method as it by design does not ask the user to inform the SDK of what kind of authentication scheme the token they're supplying it should match up against.

### Will this work in browsers?

If you generate an SDK with the CLI installation process, then yes! If you're having troubles getting autogenerated SDKs working in a browser, [please let us know](https://github.com/readmeio/api/issues)!

Unfortunately the dynamic version of `api` will **not** work in browsers as it requires access to some filesystem handling for managing its cache state.

### Will this validate my data before it reaches the API?

Not yet! This is something we've got planned down the road.

### Does this support OpenAPI definitions that require authentication to download?

Not yet! The URL that you give the module must be publicy accessible. If it isn't, you can download it to your computer/server and then use the absolute path to that file instead.

```sh
$ npx api install ./path/to/downloaded.json
```

```js
const sdk = require('api')('./path/to/downloaded.json');
```

### How do I access the Response object (for status and headers)?

By default we parse the response based on the `content-type` header for you. You can disable this by doing the following:

```js
sdk.config({ parseResponse: false });
```

### Where is the cache stored?

See [How does it work?](https://api.readme.dev/docs/how-does-it-work) for some information on how, when, and where `api` caches its data.
