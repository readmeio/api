To use the codegeneration feature that `api` offers, you can run:

```shell
$ npx api install <path to an OpenAPI definition>
```

The `api` installer will guide you through several prompts about what kind of project you'll be using the SDK with. This command supports the following URI formats for supplying an OpenAPI definition:

- ReadMe API Registry UUID
  - `@developers/v2.0#nysezql0wwo236`
    - Though this one is for our own API Reference you can see yours, or an API you wish to use, on their ReadMe API Reference documentation by viewing Node â†’ `api` code snippets.
- URLs
  - You can also access and supply the URL for your ReadMe API Registry entry by using https://dash.readme.com/api/v1/api-registry/{uuid}, where `{uuid}` is the last part of your registry entry string. So in `@developers/v2.0#nysezql0wwo236` that would be `nysezql0wwo236`.
- Local file paths
