      # There's a bug in npm@8 where, if when using Workspaces, you to install a local package that
      # isn't stored in `packages/` npm will throw an exception. This affects all of our local
      # codegen tests that attempt to test package installation. Hopefully there'll be a fix for
      # this at some point, but in the meantime we should run all tests with npm@7.
