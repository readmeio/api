      # There's a bug in npm@8 where, if when using Workspaces, you to install a local package that
      # isn't stored in `packages/` npm will throw an exception. This affects all of our local
      # codegen tests that attempt to test package installation. Because Node 14 still ships with
      # npm@6 and Node 16 with npm@7 we should always run tests with npm@9 as this issue no longer
      # exists there.
